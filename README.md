Project: Student Alcohol Consumption Analysis

Overview:

Data Preparation:

Processed and cleaned dataset, addressing null values and duplicates to ensure data quality for analysis.
Data Analysis:

Conducted extensive univariate analysis, extracting insights from 10+ visualizations (pie charts, bar charts, histograms) to understand student alcohol consumption patterns.
Advanced Analysis Techniques:

Employed bivariate analysis techniques, including heatmap visualizations, to uncover correlations. Notably identified a strong association between students majoring in Economic & Management Sciences and alcohol consumption habits.
Technical Skills:

Demonstrated proficiency in Python for data manipulation using different functions. Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization.
Academic Trends and Insights:

Discovered academic trends, including a mean GPA of 66.56%, and highlighted correlations between academic performance and extracurricular activities, contributing to a deeper understanding of student behaviors.

Repository Contents:
HTMl File: Includes Python code and its result used for analysis of data.
